syntax:

[support, lambda_low, lambda_high, num_iter] = treeapprox_binsearch(x, d, k_low, k_high, opts)

square x if you want a l2 guarantee
take abs of x if you want a l1 guarantee
d is the degree of the tree
the root of the tree is assumed to be at the first element in the row vector x
the children are at positions 2, 3, etc.

opts is optional. currently it has two fields:
- verbose
- max_num_iterations
